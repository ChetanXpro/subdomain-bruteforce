# Subdomain Finder

A simple bash script to find subdomains for a given domain using brute force. This script reads a list of subdomains from a file and checks if they exist for the specified domain.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have a list of subdomains in a file named `subdomains.txt`. Each subdomain should be on a new line.

2. Run the script with the domain you want to check:

```bash
./brute.sh example.com
